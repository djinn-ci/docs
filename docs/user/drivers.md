# Drivers

A driver is how a build is executed. In essence it is anything that can execute
a job that is specified in a build manifest. This can be anything from a Docker
container to a virtual machine or an SSH connection.

## Configuring a driver

Drivers to use for build execution are configured in the build manifest using
the `driver` property. Every driver is configured differently depending on the
type of driver being used, but each driver configuration does require the
`driver.type` property, some examples are below,

**QEMU**

    driver:
        type: qemu
        image: centos/7

<div class="panel-body" markdown>

**Docker**

</div>

    driver:
        type: docker
        image: golang
        workspace: /go

<div class="panel-body" markdown>

as a whole each driver should be configured as a list of key value pairs, where
each value is a string.

## Available drivers

Detailed below are the different drivers that are available to use for builds.
Depending on how your Djinn Server is configured, will depend on the drivers
that are available for execution.

### Docker

To configure Docker as the driver simply set the `driver.type` to `docker`. When
a build is executed via the Docker driver then a new container is used to
execute each job in the build.

Listed below are the properties required for the Docker driver,

* `driver.image` - this is the Docker container image to use for the build. This
will pull down the container image from Docker Hub.

* `driver.workspace` - this is the location in the Docker container where the
container's volume will be mounted to. This volume is used to persist state
across the containers that are used during build execution.

### QEMU

To configure QEMU as the driver simply set the `driver.type` to `qemu`. When
a build is executed via the QEMU driver, an SSH connection is opened up to the
local virtual machine, and all of the build jobs are executed as the `root`
user.

Listed below are the properties required for the QEMU driver,

* `driver.image` - this is the QCOW2 image file to use when booting a new
virtual machine for build execution. Depending on how your Djinn Server
is configured will depend on the base images that are available.

### SSH

To configure SSH as the driver simply set the `driver.type` to `ssh`. When a
build is executed via the SSH driver, an SSH connection is opened up to the
configured address. This will try and connect to the specified server as the
`root` user.

Listed below are the properties required for the SSH driver,

* `driver.address` - this is the address of the server that Djinn CI should
connect to for build execution.
