# Builds

<div class="doc-content panel" markdown>

Builds are described via a build [manifest](/user/manifest). These detail the
driver to use for execution, the code sources to pull in, the objects to place,
the stages and their respective jobs to execute, and the artifacts to collect.

## Statuses

Detailed below are the different statuses that a build can be marked as.

| STATUS               | DESCRIPTION                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Queued               | The build has been submitted, but not started execution.      |
| Running              | The build is in the process of being executed.                |
| Passed               | The build passed without failures.                            |
| Passed With Failures | The build passed but a stage that was allowed to fail failed. |
| Failed               | A stage in the build failed.                                  |
| Killed               | The build was killed.                                         |
| Timed Out            | The build took too long to execute.                           |

## Builtin jobs

When a build is submitted, a handful of jobs will be added to that build. The
first job added would be the driver creation job, that simply exists to capture
the output of driver creation. A job is added to the build for each source that
is defined in the build manifest.

## The order of build execution

Detailed below is the order in which a build is executed.

### Driver creation

First the build's driver is created before the build itself is executed. If the
driver creation exceeds 5 minutes then the build will be cancelled and marked as
Timed Out.

### Object placement

The objects specified in the [Objects](/user/manifest#objects) property of the
manifest are placed in the build environment. Failure to place an object will
not cause the build to fail.

### Source cloning

Each source repository specified in the [Sources](/user/manifest#sources)
property of the manifest are cloned. If any of the cloning fails then the build
will fail.

### Stage execution

Each stage is then executed in the order specified in the
[Stages](/user/manifest#stages) property. After each job in the stage has
completed execution then the artifacts specified via the
[Artifacts](/user/manifest#artifacts) property will be collected. If a stage
fails then this marks the build as Failed. If a stage failed, but is allowed to
fail then the build is marked as Passed With Failures.

### Driver destruction

Once the build has finished execution, either successfully or unsuccessfully,
then the driver is destroyed.

## What a job looks like

Each job in a build is treated as an individual shell script. All of the
commands in a job are concatenated together and put into a single script, for
example the following job,

</div>

    jobs:
    - stage: test
      commands:
      - cd djinn
      - go test -cover ./...
      - go test -tags "integration" ./integration

<div class="panel-body" markdown>

would become the shell script,

</div>

    #!/bin/sh
    exec 2>&1
    set -ex

    cd djinn
    go test -cover ./...
    go test -tags "integration" ./integration

<div class="panel-body" markdown>

each shell script is placed into the build environment and then executed.
