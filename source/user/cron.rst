Cron
====

Cron jobs allow you to submit build manifests at a scheduled interval. Cron jobs
can either be configured to run ``daily``, ``weekly``, or ``monthly``. When a
cron job is scheduled it will always trigger at the start of it's schedule, so a
``daily`` cron job will run at the start of the next day, ``weekly`` would be
the start of the next week, and ``monthly`` would be the start of the next month.

Crons can either be standalone, or grouped into a :doc:`Namespace </user/namespaces>`. Crons
are grouped into a namespace by specifying the namespace field in the build
manifest you want to use for that cron.
